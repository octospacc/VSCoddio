# VSCoddio

VSCoddio is a custom VSCode wrapper app for Android. It uses a WebView component to let you load VSCode for the web, but differs from using a standard browser in that it includes optimizations for mobile devices, such as fixing infamous issues with virtual keyboards.  
The app can be used to load any web VSCode instance; by default it lets you use vscode.dev, which requires no further configuration and should also work offline, but you can also add any other instance by URL, such as a self-hosted code-server.
